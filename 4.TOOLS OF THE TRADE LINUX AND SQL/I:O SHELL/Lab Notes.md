echo

Outputs a specified string of text

echo "hello"

Returns hello on the screen.

The command echo hello is the input to the shell, and hello is the output from the shell

Note: The quotation marks are optional in this case, but they tell the shell to group a series of characters together. This can be useful if you need to pass a string that contains certain characters that might be otherwise misinterpreted by the command.

expr

Performs basic mathematical calculations and can be useful when you need to quickly perform a calculation.

Note: The expr command requires that all terms and operators in an expression are separated by spaces. For example: expr 32 - 8, and not expr 32-8.

clear 

Clears the Bash shell of all existing output. This allows you to start with the cursor at the top of the Bash shell window.
